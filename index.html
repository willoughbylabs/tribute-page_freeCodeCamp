            <h2>His Story</h2>
            <h3>Milton Lee Olive III</h3>
            <h4>Born: 7 November 1946</h4>
            <h4>Sacrificed his life: 22 October 1965, age 18</h4>
            <p><q cite="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/vietnam-war-veterans-reunite-in-chicago-to-honor-milton-olive/">He was my friend. He was a super guy. He just got along with everybody and he shared cigarette rations, things like that. He liked sharing things with people around him.</q></p>
            <p class="cite"> - Samuel Grimes, one of Olive's squad mates</p>

            <p>Milton Lee Olive III spent his childhood in Chicago, and had a passion for photography. He joined the Army in 1964 and served in Company B of the 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam. He would
              take a lot of pictures at their base camp when not in combat. His friends said it was his release from the stress. On a search-and-destroy mission when his squad came under attack, he sacrificed his life by covering a grenade with his body
              to save his squad.
            </p>

            <p>Milton was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his selfless instinct. Presenting at the honoring ceremony, President Lyndon B. Johnson noted that, <q cite="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/vietnam-war-veterans-reunite-in-chicago-to-honor-milton-olive/">...in dying, Private Milton Olive taught those of us who remain how we ought to live.</q></p>

            <p>Robert Toporek, a fellow squad mate of Milton's, took that to heart. Near the end of his Army career, Toporek helped build schools, a playground, and a health center, and founded his own nonprofit, Team Children, to distribute computers and
              laptops to low-income families.</p>

            <p>Milton gave his life, so that we may carry his torch and spirit of putting others before ourselves; like Milton, it is a sentiment we should never forget.</p>

            <h4>500 N. Lake Shore Dr.</h4>
            <h4>Chicago, Illinois USA</h4>

            <p>A public park on the lakefront designed by Dan Kiley, it was dedicated to Milton Lee Olive III in 1966. The entrance gate leads you through a honey-locust tree-lined path, surrounded by circular fountains and a cantilevered deck that extends
              over Lake Michigan. The park features a statue, Hymn to Water by Milton Horn and a monument to Milton Lee Olive.</p>

            <h3>His Medal</h3>
            <h4>Medal of Honor</h4>

            <p>The Medal of Honor is the United States' most prestigious and highest military decoration. It is awarded to service men and women to recognize their distinguishable valor. It is generally awarded by the President, on behalf of Congress. Due
              to this, it is sometimes referred to as the Congressional Medal of Honor. Due to the importance of the medal, there are laws that restrict unauthorized association. </p>

            <p>Awarded to Milton for sacrificing his life, the seriousness of this medal is clear, as is the respect and honor toward its recipients.</p>
